The Black-Scholes Model assumes that financial instruments such as option contracts and futures contracts will have a 
lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and volatility.

Further assumptions:
- No dividends are paid out during the life of the derivative
- Does not factor in broker fees
- Assumes a constant risk-free rate
- Returns of the underlying are normally distributed
